Smart-Textiles
==============

A joint effort of three people, the smart textiles project can be found at http://isingthebodyelectricblr.wordpress.com/author/ritikasrikumar/ - a documentation of my group's journey through a course to integrate technology in clothing using basic sensors, microcontrollers and other miscellaneous components (mics, motors, speakers, glow in the dark paint).
Project contains sample code from this project.
